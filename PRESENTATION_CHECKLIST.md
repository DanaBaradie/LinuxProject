## Common Questions - Be Ready For:

### Technical Questions:
1. **"Why did you choose PHP?"**
   - Answer: "PHP is widely used, has excellent database support, and works well for web applications. It's also what I'm most comfortable with."

2. **"How does GPS tracking work?"**
   - Answer: "Drivers use their device's Geolocation API to get GPS coordinates, which are sent to the server and displayed on Google Maps in real-time."

3. **"Is it secure?"**
   - Answer: "Yes, I implemented multiple security measures: password hashing with bcrypt, SQL injection prevention using prepared statements, XSS protection, and CSRF tokens."

4. **"Can it handle many users?"**
   - Answer: "Yes, the database is designed to scale. With proper server resources, it can handle thousands of users."

5. **"What was the hardest part?"**
   - Answer: "Making it work perfectly on mobile devices was challenging. I had to learn responsive design principles and fix many CSS issues."

### Design Questions:
1. **"Why Bootstrap?"**
   - Answer: "Bootstrap provides a professional, responsive framework that saves development time and ensures consistency across devices."

2. **"How did you handle mobile?"**
   - Answer: "I used a mobile-first approach with CSS media queries, created touch-friendly controls, and made the sidebar collapsible."

### Feature Questions:
1. **"How do notifications work?"**
   - Answer: "The system sends automated email notifications via SendGrid when certain events occur, like when a bus is nearby or there's a delay."

2. **"Can parents communicate with drivers?"**
   - Answer: "Currently, notifications are one-way. Future enhancements could include two-way messaging."
